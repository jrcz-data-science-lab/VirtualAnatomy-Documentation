# About the project

The project is designed for nursing students at HZ University of Applied Sciences, whose nursing department is located in Vlissingen.

## Anatomy

Learning human anatomy can be challenging without the right resources. During lectures, teachers often use presentations to display different parts of the human body. 

However, the issue arises when they cannot manipulate the body parts as they wish. Instead, they must find static images from various angles, which is neither fast nor efficient.

This application will streamline the teaching process for instructors and enhance the learning experience for students.

The key benefit of using this Unreal Engine application is that the body model is fully interactive, allowing students to get a comprehensive understanding of the inner workings of the human body. 

Additionally, teachers can display organs, bones, arteries, and other anatomical structures from any angle they prefer.

## Learning

As mentioned, students can use this application to practice their anatomy knowledge. It features an interactive quiz built within Unreal Engine. The quiz questions, provided by the teachers, are fetched via an API call to a website designed for creating such quizzes [here]().

## Our Goal

Our goal is simple: to provide the most efficient way for teachers and students to gain knowledge about the human body and, in doing so, contribute positively to society.
