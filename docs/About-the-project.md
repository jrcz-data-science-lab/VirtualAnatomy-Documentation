# About the project

This project is developed for nursing department at HZ University of Applied Sciences in Vlissingen campus.

## Purpose

Nursing students often face difficulties in understanding complex anatomical structures and the effects of various medical conditions on the human body. Traditional learning methods - such as static images in presentations - do not always provide the interactivity needed for deep comprehension.

To address this, we have created an interactive Unreal Engineâ€“based application that enhances anatomy education by allowing both students and instructors to explore the human body in an engaging and dynamic way.

## Our goal

Our goal is simple: to provide the most efficient and interactive way for teachers and students to explore the human body, deepen their understanding of anatomy, and, ultimately, contribute positively to healthcare education and society.


## Interactive Anatomy

Understanding human anatomy becomes significantly easier when learners can interact with the subject matter. In standard lectures, instructors typically rely on slides filled with fixed-angle images, which limits their ability to demonstrate anatomical structures effectively.

This application streamlines the teaching process and enriches student learning by offering a fully interactive 3D model of the human body. Teachers can display organs, bones, arteries, and other structures from any angle, manipulate them freely, and guide students through complex topics in real time.

Beyond simple visualization, it is aimed that the platform includes powerful features to support and enrich the curriculum such as detailed anatomical descriptions, layered filtering options, guided tours, demonstration of illnesses, and so on.

## Interactive Learning

Students could strengthen their understanding through interactive features included in the application. These elements are intended to complement traditional learning methods by encouraging exploration and offering opportunities for self-assessment in a more engaging format.

By integrating with external educational platforms, the application could support a variety of instructional materials and activities aligned with the nursing curriculum.
