# Welcome

Hello, welcome to the documentation for the 3D-Anatomy-Project built by [JRCZ Data Science Lab](https://jrcz.nl/en/data-science-lab.html)

## General overview

The project itself is divided into several repositories:

- 3D Unreal Engine application [GitHub](https://github.com/jrcz-data-science-lab/Unreal-Engine-3D-Anatomy)
    - This project is the meat of the whole thing, it contains the Unreal Engine project that can be loaded into UE5.

- Quiz, Django web application [GitHub](https://github.com/jrcz-data-science-lab/digital_anatomy_quiz)
    - Quiz creation web application, teachers are creating quizzes here that are retrieved in the UE application.

- Frontend for model tagging, Django web application [GitHub](https://github.com/jrcz-data-science-lab/anatomy_web)
    - Since different years of the nursing study need to see different parts of the anatomy, teachers can configure this through this website.

- Python script for importing the Blender models to the Unreal Engine [GitHub](https://github.com/jrcz-data-science-lab/blender-scripts)
- Python script for generating JSON files that can be loaded in the Model tagging application [GitHub](https://github.com/jrcz-data-science-lab/Anatomy-blender-auto-prepare)     
- This documentation [GitHub](https://github.com/jrcz-data-science-lab/3D-Anatomy-Documentation)

## Structure of this documentation

This documentation is mainly focused on the Unreal Engine application but in the future, we plan to expand it to other projects as well.

Keep in mind that we tried to make this cover as much as possible but as you will soon understand, it is quite difficult to handle all the HZ shenanigans, develop new features, and document it. :)
