# Explorer Level vs. Hospital Level

You might be wondering what the difference is between the **Hospital Level** and the **Explorer Level** (also abbreviated as `explorer-level-no-enviroment`). Let’s break it down.

## Hospital Level
The **Hospital Level** is designed primarily for presenting the application to clients. As such, it includes advanced and resource-intensive features like:
- Expensive lighting operations
- Real-time ray tracing
- Global illumination
- Light occlusion
- Lens flare
- God rays

While these features make the level visually stunning, they also make it extremely demanding on system resources. For this reason, we strongly discourage working on this level. It’s not that we don’t want you to have fun—it’s just that this level is a resource-hungry powerhouse best reserved for client presentations.

## Explorer Level
In contrast, the **Explorer Level** is designed for speed and performance. All new features should be implemented in this level, as performance is critical for this project. It’s optimized to ensure smooth operation and efficiency, making it the ideal environment for development and testing. Once new features are implemented you are free to put them to the hospital level. 

## Cinematic Sequences
You might also be curious about the purpose of the **cinematic sequences**. As the name suggests, these are used to create the application’s trailer. The master sequencer governs every shot, which is essentially a prerecorded camera movement. These sequences help showcase the application in a dynamic and engaging way.
