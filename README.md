Documentation created using MkDocs.

[Link](https://jrcz-data-science-lab.github.io/VirtualAnatomy-Documentation/)

## Branches 
- **`main`**: Contains the main content of the documentation.
- **`gh-pages`**: Auto-generated by a bot, contains the published documentation.

## Installation 

Ensure that you have `pip` and `python` installed.

Then, run the following command to install MkDocs:

```bash
pip install mkdocs
```

We use material theme and so should you ;), install it using following.

```bash
pip install mkdocs-material
```

Afterward, serve the documentation locally by running:

```bash
mkdocs serve
```

Make sure to execute this command in the root of the repository.

## Adding Pages 

You should **always** add new `.md` files to the `docs` folder. You can create new folders and sub folders if necessary. 

If your file is located inside the `docs` folder it will get automatically interpreted by the mk-docs framework

## Updating the deployed website

Once you're done, `add` your changes, `commit`, and `push`. The GitHub action will trigger, and the `gh-pages` branch will be updated with your changes (bot will deploy it as static website and push to the `gh-page` branch).
