# Virtual Anatomy Documentation
Documentation for the [Virtual Anatomy project](https://github.com/jrcz-data-science-lab/Virtual-Anatomy-UE) created on MkDocs.

## Branches 
- **`main`**: Contains the main content of the documentation.
- **`gh-pages`**: Auto-generated by a bot, contains the published documentation.

## Installation 

First of all, ensure that you have `pip` and `python` packages installed.

Then, run the following command to install MkDocs (and its plugin, necessary for appropriate display of the content):

```bash
pip install mkdocs
pip install mkdocs-nav-weight
```

The material theme is used within this documentation. For the best UI experience install it using the following command:

```bash
pip install mkdocs-material
```

Afterward, you can serve the documentation locally by running:

```bash
mkdocs serve
```

**Make sure to execute this command in the root of the repository.**

## Adding Pages 

You should **always** add new `.md` files to the `docs` folder. You can create new folders and sub folders if necessary. 

If your file is located inside the `docs` folder it will get automatically interpreted by the mk-docs framework.

## Updating the deployed website

Once you are done with (part of) your documentation, `add` your changes, `commit`, and `push` them to `main` branch. The GitHub action will trigger, and the `gh-pages` branch will be updated with your changes (bot will deploy it as static website and push to the `gh-page` branch).

## Additional plugins for MkDocs
- **`mkdocs-nav-weight`**: plugin that enables to organize sequence of mkdocs chapters/pages on the side navigation menu. ([Link](https://github.com/shu307/mkdocs-nav-weight?tab=readme-ov-file))
